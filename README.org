* What's this?

A web-site for drawing polygons, polyhedra and polychora, written in ClojureScript. This
is a complementary program for my essay "Rotation and Mirroring in the plane
R^2, the Space R^3 and the Hyperspace R^3", which I created
in the course of the seminar "Polygons, Polyhedra and Polychora". The writing of a
scientific essay as part of a seminar is part of the graduation from German high school,
the Abitur.
