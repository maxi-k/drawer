* What's this?

A web-site for drawing polygons, polyhedra and polychora, written in ClojureScript. This
is a complementary program for my essay "Rotation and Mirroring in the plane
R2, the Space R3 and the Hyperspace R4", which I created
in the course of the seminar "Polygons, Polyhedra and Polychora". The writing of a
scientific essay as part of a seminar is part of the graduation from German high school,
the Abitur.

* Controls

- ALT: Change the active camera (There are two cameras because there are 4
  dimensions)
- LEFT ARROW: Increases the active camera's x-position ('moving the screen
  content to the left')
- RIGHT ARROW: Decreases the active camera's x-position ('moving the screen
  content to the right')
- UP ARROW: Decreases the active camera's y-position ('moving the screen content
  down')
- DOWN ARROW: Increases the active camera's y-position ('moving the screen
  content up')
- PAGE UP: Decreases the active camera's z-position ('zooming in') [mac: fn-up]
- PAGE DOWN: Increases the active camera's z-position ('zooming out') [mac: fn-down]
- HOME: Decreases the active camera's w-position ('zooming into the 4th
  dimension') [mac: fn-left]
- END: Increases the active camera's w-position ('zooming out of the 4th
  dimension') [mac: fn-right]

HOME and END only have a visible effect when manipulating camera 1, because it
is the one projecting 4D to 3D
